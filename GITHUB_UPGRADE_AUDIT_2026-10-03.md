# GitHub Upgrade Audit — Fire Phoenix

**Audit date:** 2026-10-03
**Scope:** local repository, preserved remote-tracking reference, tracked-content scan, GitHub workflow/configuration files, and repository-management documentation.
**External-admin limitation:** GitHub branch rules, secret-scanning availability, actual Actions run state, labels, and project boards require authenticated administrator access to inspect or change.

## Verified baseline

- Private remote: `https://github.com/gm5206663-bit/fire-phoenix-workshop`
- Baseline remote-tracking state: local `main` and `origin/main` both resolved to `4cc2357` before this upgrade package.
- Git integrity: `git fsck --no-reflogs` passed; working tree was clean before upgrade edits.
- Project integrity: all recovery, workshop, frozen V1, protected V2, Option A staging, and local-acceptance checks passed.
- Credential screen: no high-confidence token, private-key, AWS-key, or bearer-credential pattern was found in tracked content.
- Repository footprint: packed Git database approximately 4.45 MiB; largest tracked file approximately 1.1 MiB; Git LFS is unnecessary.
- Quarantine boundary: the rejected Dorm333-only Chapter 53 prose remains intentionally ignored and untracked.

## Improvements applied in this upgrade package

1. SHA-pinned GitHub Actions and disabled checkout credential persistence.
2. Added workflow concurrency, Dependabot monitoring for GitHub Actions, and GitHub governance validation.
3. Added private issue forms for continuity, source-claim, and publication-decision records.
4. Added `CODEOWNERS`, `.editorconfig`, changelog, notice, classification policy, backup/recovery procedure, label/project-board plan, and GitHub admin settings checklist.
5. Added an ignored local Git-bundle backup target and governance/credential screen to the standard validation suite.
6. Corrected current navigation so the private GitHub mirror is not misdescribed as an absence of push/remote authority while public publication remains blocked.

## Remaining GitHub-admin actions

After this upgrade is pushed and the first Actions run is visibly successful, use `GITHUB_ADMIN_SETTINGS_CHECKLIST.md` to:

- create the private label taxonomy and optional Project board;
- enable secret scanning/push protection and Dependabot alerts where the account plan supports them;
- establish the `main` ruleset with force-push/deletion protection and the validation status check;
- decide whether collaborators justify mandatory pull-request/code-owner review.

## Deliberate non-actions

- No public visibility, GitHub Pages, release, public Project, or public Discussions setup.
- No license added automatically for fan-work/recovered evidence.
- No Git LFS migration.
- No source, state, gate, rule, public-publication, C56, or C61 alteration.

## Credential note

Any credential pasted into chat must be considered exposed and revoked after its intended one-time use. This audit does not retain or reproduce any credential.
