## Interpretation

- HTTP `200`, `201`, `202`, or `204` records a GitHub-accepted configuration action. A `422` label result normally means the label already existed; other non-success codes are retained above for manual follow-up rather than silently treated as success.
- `main_branch_protection` returned `403`: it is **not enabled**. GitHub reports that this private repository needs GitHub Pro (or public visibility) for that feature. Public visibility is not authorized; retain the private repository and use local hooks/CI until a paid-plan decision is made.
- The governance-upgrade workflow run completed successfully. The later receipt-commit run should still be checked in GitHub Actions before relying on it as a recurring remote check.
- Dependabot/security endpoints depend on repository eligibility and account-plan settings; their response codes do not imply secret scanning/push protection was enabled.

## Still intentionally not done

- No public visibility, Pages, public release, webhook, external deployment, public Project, or public Discussions space.
- No mandatory pull-request/code-owner review while the repository has one maintainer.
- No claim that secret scanning/push protection is enabled without confirming it in GitHub settings.

## Credential handling

A one-time scoped credential was used for this administration task and removed from the workspace afterward. It must be revoked by the account owner after use.
